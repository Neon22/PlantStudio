For breeding offspring, the mean value for each parameter (before it is mutated) is created by blending the parameter values of the two parents. This slider shows the relative weight of the first parent. (The first parent is the first plant chosen in the main window or breeder.) For example, for a particular parameter, if the first parent's value is 50 and the second parent's value is 20, and the relative weight is 80 percent, the resulting value will be (50 * 0.8) + (20 * 0.2) = 44."

If you already have two sides and want to redo their symmetry, remove all the triangles on one side and then click this button."
TTdoEditorForm	TSpeedButton	reverseZValues	Reverse	"Sometimes when you make a 3D object it comes out backward, and when you put it on the plant it seems upside-down. This is because you pushed the Z values when you should have pulled. The direction of Z values is hard to keep straight, so if your 3D object turns out backwards, click this button and the 3D object will reverse itself. Try it a few times to see what it does."
