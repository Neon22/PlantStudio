PS v2.0 to-do list as of 8/6/2000

============= last-minute alpha testing problems

FIX NOW:
jpeg problem with crashing !! no progress and ran out of virtual memory - could not duplicate
DONE disable rotation, color, scale etc boxes for posing if checkbox above turned off
DONE on new windows (prginfo and 3ds options) forms must have scaled set to false - and one other? check (for fonts)
DONE "show posing" clipped on P screen - also other words

at least look at now:
for posing, you cannot select parts unless the window drawing is solids (not in wire frame etc)

ignore for now:
posing a leaf, rotating it, does not rotate the stipule; rotating an inflorescence does not rotate the bracts
breeder list index out of bounds after delete all, -1, can't find again
breeder - send copy to main window - enabled when no plant is selected - check both menus
add close box to welcome window - means "start using program now"
maybe - put select all/none under edit menu
maybe - make label for plant in panels bold to stand out more
when expand/collapse all params in section, should have wait cursor

look at later:
issue: not obvious how to get secondary flowers
small problem: when move biomass slider to lowest amount, number draws behind slider and gets covered up - needs more space
when looking at one plant at a time, if click off plant no plant is selected but you can still see plant;
  and when you right click the menu is disabled but you can still see the plant; you have to know to
  click on the plant again to select it. messy.
startup flicker
startup wait cursor flicker
in undo/redo window horizontal scroll bar even if things not long - am I doing this right?
age line on different panel?
no wait cursor while breeder / time series redraws
when in breeder and part of plant is showing and you change plants per generation to be less than plants showing
  it does not redraw that part of a plant ...
look at optimizing time needed to load parameters for section in main window - for long ones takes forever
consider changing how rotations go up and down - instead of going down from 0 to -10, go down from 0 to 350

============= CYNTHIA

make some plants using new parameters to test
more testing of backward-compatibility on parameters
parameter hints

for posing, fix line selection algorithm with generation of triangles - it's not good enough

check new commands for plant memory used

new thank-you easter eggs

general testing

disable reg. codes that have been published on newsgroups - p sent email to c

lump posing commands together if amendment is same and thing changed is same

parameter for hiding first and second internodes (ugly) - or - fix width of first and second internodes

10% variation in random sway as default ?? - implications ?

random numbers generated in breeder are all the same (time index) - add counter or something

============= PAUL

rotate around point when click

take look at easy way to throw gravity/wind in (angle displacement?)

not redrawing when expose plants from under splitter bar (main window)

============= PROBABLY NOT

super-collapse?
spin rotate button/menu option? (slow)

============= DO AFTER BETA AND BEFORE 2.0 RELEASE

remove beta turnoff
change version info in splash screen
documentation
library files - add a few more plants created with new floral parts as examples
save & load all old library files - with boxes and packing
readme file
installer
posting on web site - news, update features list, etc
consider starting mailing list or delphi forum or something
change version info in delphi project options

============= LATER

fix bug about biomass allocation in GWI - may not be setting new biomass allocation to zero between days

============= DONE

BUG - in main window, intermittent problem; click on panel, plants resize - why?
DONE posing changes saved with file, must also be saved to and loaded from memo for clipboard - do as in utdo
DONE posing with internodes and angle curving
read and write arrangements list with plant (remember plant file and clipboard)
get main-window spinedits to work better with editing (make work like rotation ones in arrangement panel)
add remembering name of plants last selected to plant file or ini options
change general time-out date to 2002, not 2001 
make beta version turn off in october or so
would like to show how much memory the whole program is using (and each plant) in program info window (from about box)
  in general, could improve program info in various ways (look at)
DONE sum up biomasses for gravity
fix all "raise exception.create" and "errormessage" calls so they look nicer if there is actually a problem
  (and so they give us better info on where the problem is)
  new format is "Problem: [error state] in method [method]."
malloc 3d objects to reduce memory use
test for memory leaks
change lower bound on all biomass params to 0.0001
put breeder age option back, in breeding options window
undo list?
check for version number in reading plants - both from file and from clipboard text - if version > 2 refuse to read
write out new version number in plants and plant file - both file and clipboard
-- decided not to refuse to read, but to warn.
if ps2 settings file available, read. if ps2 settings file not available but ps1 file there, read that.
always write out ps2 settings file - but call it PlantStudio2.ini
button hints
one more look at colors in 3DS

============= NOT GOING TO DO

add remembering debug window position to ini file
