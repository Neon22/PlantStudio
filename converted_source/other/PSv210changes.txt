Changes between final 2.01 version and 2.1

* transverse sections
* overrides must have section as well as param name - not backward compatible - new overrides
    cannot be read by older versions - probably not a problem, people don't use this much
* fixed bug where does not check for PLA extension when opening from sendto
* changed bounds on all petals, sepals, bracts, pistils, stamens from (1-10) to (0-30)
* added option to ignore window settings in file (useful if you like the window a certain way)
* updated splash screen and about box for 2002 copyright and (R) trademark
* fixed bug where animations would not save to a hard disk with a very large amount of free space
* when checking to see that there is enough space to save files, padded estimate to be more safe
* fixed help and options dialog where it said paste rect size was for paste + paste from text, is just for latter
* fixed small bug where plants dragged from breeder when looking at one plant at a time were not sizing correctly
