Changes after final 2.0 version





Changes between beta 3 and final 2.0 version

* improved action of paste & new plant - now keeps old selections for undo
* speeded up saving & loading of settings info ten-fold (removed "please wait" message)
* improved speed of switching between view-one and view-all modes
* if you change the drawing options on the main window and the breeder/time series have plants
    but are not showing, they will not redraw until they appear again
* changed lower bound on parameter [General parameters: Age at maturity] so that
    breeder could not produce plants with age of zero (one reason for blank plants)
* changed delete/cut so that if you are in view-one mode it automatically selects the first plant in the list
    (so you still have something to look at)
* changed time series window so numbers are days the plant is old at each stage, not just stage numbers
* made it so that you can't select by rubber banding when in view-one mode (doesn't make sense)
* added option in all 3d output formats to write double-sided polygons (front-face color only)
* changed parameter panels to take up all available space (looks cleaner)
* fixed bug where window would not redraw properly when stats panel was showing
* improved ability of posing selection to pick up really thin internode lines
* fixed floating spin edit box in preferences window
* improved reading from file or clipboard to deal with most cases of line wrapping (not all)
    deals with [ or = being on next line, does NOT deal with text of name wrapped
* changed "numerical exceptions" window to "messages" window
* added messages when parameters are defaulted and wrapped lines are merged when reading.
    these will appear in messages window
* fixed small bug in "read from text" method that makes it work faster
* added "saving preferences" message at end - taking a while to quit because of many new options
* fixed bug where using high breeder variation would turn on varying 3D objects (supposed to be separate now)
* changed "randomize parameters" BACK to "randomize" because the second meaning was not accurate
* changed method of writing out preferences to settings file to make it (much) faster shutting down
    and added message that preferences are being saved
* changed sections list box for parameters (on left side) to drop-down list (above) to make
    more room for parameters. looks better. moved some popup menu items around.
* improved the 2D picture saving to the clipboard, file or printer to warn you
    if you are about to save a picture over 10 MB, and added a memory-use estimation to the window
* improved 2D export to JPEG; added support for variable JPEG compression
    removed estimation for JPEG; files are small and estimation is pretty much impossible
    removed choice of color depth for JPEG; only 24-bit is available
* improved the way flower buds open up into flowers a bit
* improved saving of recent file names
* changed label in 3D object chooser to drop-down list, so you can find a 3D object by name
    as well as by shape
* added "send copy to main window" to time series window, works same as for breeder
* improved speed of multiple undo/redo; added "please wait" window; disabled all windows during operation
* in drawing area, previously if you clicked without dragging in rotate mode you would always
    rotate in the X dimension by 10 degrees. now it uses the "rotation change with up or down click"
    value, and a right-click rotates in the X dimension but in the opposite direction.
* fixed a few bugs in posing - leaves were not being pruned; edit boxes were responding incorrectly
* removed colors from posing
* improved posing panel - added on/off buttons for three posing things
* added posing colors to preferences window
* revamped preferences window to make it more clear
* moved two preferences to breeding & time series options window (max plant parts, update time series window)
    less confusing
* cleaned up breeding options window
* improved posing by adding "posing selection cursor mode" with special cursor - cleaner and easier to understand
* fixed bug where sometimes cursor was wrong when file was opened - always change to select/drag mode now
* improved undo/redo window to say "undo" or "redo" instead of just "ok" - so it's more clear what you are doing
* fixed a bug with posing (and with plant drawing) where inflorescences with branches were not drawing
    individual flowers correctly
* filled in parameter hints for new parameters, improved all parameter hints (and parameter ordering)
    for better consistency and better explanation
* fixed bug where file with "view one only" option set on not read correctly on loading
* improved testing for hacked registration codes (if you paid for PS, you'll appreciate this)
* added parameter to draw opposite as well as alternate leaflets in compound leaves
* added saving window position and size for 3D object editor
* improved reading of settings file so in rare condition where people used PS < 1.4 and have an old settings file
    with comma-delimited numbers (e.g., 1,5) it will still read the file correctly
* updated, revamped and reorganized help system; added many graphics and some tutorial sections; added
    more comprehensive FAQ section based on emails received in last two years


(* EMAIL FROM PERSON ABOUT UPDATING BUG
However, with the beta I've experienced a few problems working with the main window.
If you have over 20 plants in the file, it can be
difficult & time-consuming to properly size & arrange them all, even with the new packing feature.
As a result, I try to keep no more than
12 or 13 plants in each file.  
 
Also when there's 20 or more plants in the file & you go to the single plant view
and attempt to change plants, the previous plant image
sometimes remains & the new plant image appears on top of it.  In other words,
when you select another plant, the previous image
remains rather than being dismissed.  This sometimes happens when you create a
new file or transfer new plants to an existing file.
 
So, other than difficulty working with the main window, I've enjoyed using the 2.0 beta.  Each time I work with the parameters, I learn
something new.  PlantStudio has so much depth built into it, there will always be something new to learn.

POV
changed thing at end to happen even if only one plant
automatically add underscores to file name because pov can't handle them

OBJ
if you write colors a second materials file *.mtl will be written






PlantStudio v2.0 changes

============= Major new features (see below for details)

* New modeled parts - pistils, stamens, five layers of petals, sepals, inflorescence bracts, leaf stipules
* 3DS output - with same grouping options as DXF
* Posing of individual plant parts - so you can hide or bend whole branches by hand
* More arrangement options for plants on screen including align, size and pack
* Multiple undo/redo at once

============= Model

* Renamed the flower types from "female/male" to "primary/secondary". This is
more botanically accurate, since we had been using "female" to mean "female/hermaphroditic".
Actually, 90% of flowering plants have "perfect" flowers with both male and female parts,
so the new naming convention is easier to understand.

* Expanded primary flowers to include pistils, stamens, five rows of petals, and sepals.
New primary flower parameters are in new "Advanced" section.

* Expanded secondary flowers to include stamens, one row of petals, and sepals.

* Added parameters to draw leaf stipules (extra leafy-things at the bases of leaf stems).

* Added parameters to draw inflorescence bracts (extra leafy-things at the bases of inflorescences).

* Created a few new plants to illustrate the use of the new flower and leaf structures.

* Added the ability to "pose" (change aspects of) individual plant parts:
  internodes (stem segments)
  meristems (buds)
  leaves
  inflorescences (flower clusters)
  flowers/fruits
Posing is useful when you have a plant that looks the way you want, but a flower or leaf
or branch isn't turned the right way or isn't the size you want. You can use posing to artificially
create (without explicitly modeling) the look of pruning, twining around things, variation,
damage, and the effects of gravity or wind by amending branches or leaves "by hand".
Posing changes are saved in the plant file. All posing changes are removed when you do anything that causes
the plant's "grown" parts to change, such as randomizing the parameters or changing any parameter
that causes the plant to restructure. (You can undo all of these changes, so if
your posing changes suddenly disappear, just undo until you get the changes back.)
Posing changes don't carry over into breeding, but they do show up in a time series.

* Changed plant file specification to version 2.0. Files are backward compatible: PS 1.x can read 2.x files
and display them properly (though ignoring parameters for the new 2.0 flower parts).
PS 2.x can read 1.x files and display them properly, though all the new parameters will be set to defaults.
If you open a 1.x version plant and save it, it will turn into a 2.x file.

* Fixed bug where copying a plant with the parameter [General parameters: Random sway in drawing angles] set to
any number greater than zero would produce a copy that drew differently (until regrown).

* Reduced memory required for plants by optimizing 3D object code.

* Removed limit of 1000 points on 3D objects imported from DXF.

* Added new lower bound for all "optimal biomass" parameter of 0.0001 percent of maximum plant biomass.
Reduces likelihood of problems in breeding.

============= Input/Output

* Added 3DS output. Grouping options are the same as for DXF and POV.

* Note that a user has reported (and we have verified) that some programs don't understand our multiple-plant
DXF files correctly, reading only one plant at a time. We haven't fixed this because (a) it's difficult
and (b) you can use 3DS now. If you find this problem with 3DS, let us know.

* Added JPEG output for 2D pictures (not for animations or nozzles/tubes).

* Added registration reminder to 3D output - a box appears at the base of each plant until you register.
Changed reminder window to reflect this.

============= Overall interface

* There are many new options in PS2 and so the settings file is somewhat changed. The old settings file, called
"PlantStudio.ini" and placed in your Windows directory by default, is left alone by PS2. PS2 makes a NEW
settings file called "PlantStudio2.ini" and places it in your Windows directory by default. PS2 copies the information
from your PS1 settings file so you don't have to re-enter it, but then separates the new settings file out.
We did this so that if you want to keep PS1 and PS2 on your computer at the same time (e.g., while
playing with the beta version), you won't have to worry about losing settings. The settings
files are supposed to be forward and backward compatible - but this way is safest.

Special note: If you use an "alternate" settings file name, PS2 can't tell what version it is and
so it will just update your settings file with the new PS2 settings.

* Fixed several places where non-default-gray background didn't show through icons correctly.

* Made new (nicer looking) splash screen and about box!

* Added "program info" window (separate from numerical exceptions window) which can be
accessed from about box or numerical exceptions window. Added more diagnostic information, including memory use of plants.

* Improved information content of error messages throughout program (not that you should see any, but now they are more
informative).

* Plants now save their visible/invisible state, and whether they were selected or not (in the main window only),
so that when you return to the same plant file you return to the same selections.

============= Main window

* Added "Undo/Redo List" where you can see all the actions you've made and undo or redo several actions at a time.
Improved undo/redo descriptive names to give more detail. Window position is saved in settings file.

* Changed "Rotations" panel to "Arrangement" panel and added several new things to it.
* You can now set the XY location and drawing scale (size) of selected plants in the
arrangement panel as well as with the mouse.
* New alignment buttons line up the selected plants by top, bottom, left or right sides.
* New equal-width and equal-height buttons make the selected plants the same height or width.
* The "Pack" button makes all the selected plants the same height (their average height)
and lines them up within the drawing area, wrapping around if necessary.
* All of these things also work from the Layout menu.

* Changed "Life cycle" panel to "Age" panel to save space. Otherwise it is not changed.

* Added "Posing" panel to interact with new plant part posing functionality in model (see "Model" section).

* Changed the default to NOT showing secondary (male) flower/inflorescence parameters (see "Model" section
for name change). You can still see the secondary flower parameters again if you choose
"Show Secondary Flower Parameters" in the parameter sections right-click menu.
If you have secondary flower parameters "turned off" the primary ones will just say "Flowers",
not "Primary flowers". People didn't seem very interested in the separate flowers, so it makes sense
to make them harder to trip over.

* Added option to show bounding boxes of plants at all times. You can use this to create a sort of
"picture box" effect in a plant file. This option is saved with the plant file.

* Fixed longstanding but infrequently seen bug where plants in main window would resize for no good reason.

* Changed parameters panel to show the name of the plant whose parameters you are changing.

* Added hints for headers in parameter panels. These hints describe the parameters below the header
as a group.

* Changed weird "concentrate" terminology to simply "view one plant at a time" vs. "view all plants" and "place drawing
area on top" vs. "place drawing area on side". Added buttons in tool bar to change these more quickly.
Saved both of these settings in plant file, so they are remembered when you open the file again.

* When drawing area is on left side, moved list of plants to top of window instead of bottom. Makes more sense.

* Added check to see if plants are off screen when loaded from file - if so, they are relocated onto the screen.

* Added little margin to "scale to fit" -- that is, when you click Scale to Fit PlantStudio leaves a little
margin around the drawing area instead of jamming the plants up to the edges. Looks better.

* Added saving of numerical exceptions window position in settings file.

============= Breeder

* Changed breeder so resizing does not resize plants. Now thumbnail size is set using breeder Options dialog.

* Removed all choices from bottom of breeder window and moved them to Options dialog.

* Changed how breeder draws - instead of watching progress bar and seeing nothing, now you see
the plants "play out" across the screen as they are drawn. Each plant shows a gray box while
it is drawing. Most plants take less than a second or two to draw.

* Added toolbar to breeder for setting options and breeding from the selected plant(s).

* Separated three types of breeding options out for easier access: numerical parameters, colors, and 3D objects.
Now you can vary each of these independently of the others. You can breed plants with identical structure
but different colors, or identical colors but different structure, or identical colors and structure but
different 3D objects. This makes it much easier to "zoom in" on a plant you like. And it's more fun!

* Added new "Send Copy to Main Window" menu option to the breeder menu. This copies the selected breeder
plant to the current file in one step (instead of dragging, or copying and pasting).
"Sent" plants appear in the middle of the main window drawing area. You can undo this
(it's just a copy followed by a paste).

* Removed dark-blue marker for "selected generation" in breeder. Was not very informative, just annoying.

* You can now make more plants per generation, up to 100.

* Copied the "Draw Using" options over to the breeder and time series window (same as in main window).
Same effect on all three windows as before.

* Fixed bug where breeder plants did not retain the rotations of the parent plant. Now if you breed
a plant from the main window, all bred plants will retain its angles. (If you breed from two parents,
the first parent's rotation will be used for all offspring.)

============= Time series window

* Changes similar to those of breeder - resizing the window doesn't resize the plants, drawing goes across screen
as you watch, no stuff at the bottom of the window.

* New labels on time series stages.

* Up to 100 stages allowed in time series now.
