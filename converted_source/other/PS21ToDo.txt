Things to fix in PS2.1





DONE
- link up help for orthogonal sections
- bug with override and picking up secondary flowers instead of primary - change
    overrides to work with section name as well as parameter ?
- range for num primary petals 0-30 but for all other floral parts (pistils, stamens, other petals, sepals) 0-10
    should be 0-30 for all
- registered trademark in help system
- r in about box?? (YES)
- consider making save/load orientation info with file optional (preference) - sometimes you
    don't want it when you have the window looking a nice way
- add preference to ignore screen settings in plant file when loading
- bug with hard disk for one export type - check emails

NOT DOING
- one/all and top/side buttons on main window need more bitmap sections for disabled state
(these seem okay the way they are)
- when load plant from send-to operation, file name gets messed up. any way to fix this?
(tried, doesn't seem to be any way to fix it)
- if change param and redrawing, no progress bar; fine for quick redraws but not good for very complex
    plants that take a long time to redraw. improve this?
(looked at, could change but might break something else)
